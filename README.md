# First_ReactNative_App
This was my first given project using react native during year 4 at NTI Södertörn

## Requirements
3 pages: Home, Weather and News. For weather and news we had to use an api to fetch the data and display it to the user, each page also had to have a home button.

## Images
Homescreen on both IOS and Android
